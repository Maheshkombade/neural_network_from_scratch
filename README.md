# Introduction 

In this project I tried to make the neural network model from scratch. The Neural network is capable of handling any number of nodes, and hidden layers.

I tested the network on the MNIST dataset and was able to achieve a accuracy of 98.15% on training data, and 97.34% on the test data.
